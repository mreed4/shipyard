# Shipyard.js

I love sci-fi and want to practice writing classes. I also want to practice import/export.

This project uses **JavaScript classes** (e.g. `class Ship {}`) to describe both fictional **ship classes** (e.g., in the real world, "Ohio-class submarine"), as well as ship _types_ (e.g. "Carrier", "Frigate", etc.). The terminology in the commits might get a little confusing.

Right now there is no UI. It is console/terminal only.

In any case, maybe someday this could be used as part of something much larger--i.e. something similar to [CyberCode Online](https://cybercodeonline.com/) (repo [here](https://github.com/DexterHuang/CyberCodeOnline)).
