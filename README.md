# Shipyard.js

I love sci-fi and want to practice writing classes. I also want to practice import/export.

Maybe someday this could be used as part of something much larger--i.e. something similar to [CyberCode Online](https://cybercodeonline.com/) (repo [here](https://github.com/DexterHuang/CyberCodeOnline)).
